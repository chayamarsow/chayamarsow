- 💻 So far, I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, mostly through freeCodeCamp.
- 🔒 I previously studied cybersecurity, and am active on TryHackMe.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love debugging, or more specifically, the feeling of satisfaction from finding and fixing the bug. 🐞
