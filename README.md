# 👋 Hi, I’m Chaya. Here's a bit about me:
- 🧑‍💻 I like to learn and code in my free time.
- 💻 Some languages I work with are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- 🌱 One thing I’m currently working on is React, mostly through freeCodeCamp.
- 🔒 I previously studied cybersecurity, and am active on TryHackMe.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love debugging, or more specifically, the feeling of satisfaction from finding and fixing the bug. 🐞
